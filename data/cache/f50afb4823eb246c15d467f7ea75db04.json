The interface uses and makes available a limited amount of functionality found in java.awt.Graphics class. Simply explained Java2D is a type of paint application for java, how to write code instead of drawing with the mouse pointer. Like the paint has Java2D methods to create rectangles, circles, curves and text. In addition, it is also possible to use to create graphics images. Most methods used can be divided into two main sections: Draw and Fill methods that create shapes, text and images Methods that change how shapes, text and images created Examples of such methods are drawRectangle2D and fillEllipse2D that with will create different shapes on the basis of the parameters they provide. SetColor and setComposite are methods that specify the properties of shapes that can be created. An important factor when it comes to Java2D is that when something is drawn or written to userspace (koordinatnettet located in the bottom for everything to be displayed graphically) these can not be changed dynamically. If you want to change what you have drawn, it does not help to just change the object / objects in code. One must &quot;wipe out&quot; what has been made, and draw it again, after it is changed in the code. So there is no automatic rendering of the objects you draw. .. The page is not complete"}
