Note that there are ways in which changes in content, then in practice function as values. Instead of changing the content builds a new instances of content from existing. To facilitate this, Java has its own syntax for constants, the + operator can be used to set the same instances and values ​​and objects are automatically converted to instances in many contexts. The following code illustrates several of these: First, the variable is initialized to one containing character sequence D, e, t, t, e,, e, r,, e, n, s, t, r, i, n, g and then initializes variable using. + Operator to the composition of &#39;a&#39; First letter of &quot;authority-that s refers to the&quot; is &quot;and the first character (position 0). This will provide one with the characters &quot;First letter in which a is D&quot;, which is the initializing of. This is then printed off. An alternative line of code that gives the same result is: Here we see that the &#39;one that was initialized to the place, now is placed directly into the expression used as an argument to. Note in particular that one can actually call a method on &#39;a direct, instead of using a variable (handy when testing methods). Second, the method instead, to extract the first letter. Here are some useful methods that it just has to learn first as last: returns the character position where the first character has position 0 Eg. will return the character b returns the position of the first character that is equal to, and, or -1 if the character does not exist in this&#39; one. Eg. will return 1 returns the position of this&#39; one where the entire contents of present and or -1. Eg. will return 1 returns whether this&#39; one contains contents somewhere. Eg. will return. returns if this&#39; one starts with the letters (in the same order), otherwise returned. Eg. will return. returns if this&#39; one ends with letters (in the same order), otherwise returned. Eg. will return. returns a new instance-with letters (if provided) position (but not with) position. Eg. will return. returns a new instance-with letters from (and including) position to the end. Eg. will return."}
