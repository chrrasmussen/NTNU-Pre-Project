If you have previously understood object oriented programming, Java implementasjonenene be significantly easier to understand. If you do object oriented programming is hard to understand, it may help to see it in the Java context. Defining a class A class typically consists of fields, methods and constructor (s). The interaction between these define behavior and state of the object. Fields and methods class - which means &quot;owner&quot; of the contents of {} is a class. public - This defines the visibility of the class. Often working programs with multiple classes, and sometimes one that classes will &quot;know&quot; about each other, sometimes not. More about visibility, see Encapsulation and Synlighetsmodifikatorer. MyDescriptiveAndConciseClassname - The name of the class. Have chosen a relatively stupid class name, but this is just to illustrate that it may be exactly what you want. In addition, the name tells what kind of class name you really want; descriptive and concise at once. This is a class with horrible little sense, but either way, a class. It is here selected a short and precise class name, and you should not be in doubt about what this class &quot;represents&quot;. Song-class have here three fields. A field acts like a normal variable, but rather to be declared in a function, declared field of the class. Items can be thought of as the class properties. That is a field acts as a global variable in the class. When creating features classes tend to calling features class methods. The methods are built on exactly the same way as a Function Functions. Here it established two methods; getTitle () and setTitle (...) which respectively return and change the field title. These are called getter and setters, who can read more about the Encapsulation. countWordInLyrics (...) is a method that either returns or change any of the fields in the class, but performs a calculation based on the values ​​of one of the fields Constructors A constructor is a special method that is called only when creating a new instance of a class , thus creating a new object. If an object is dependent on the fields x and y have values ​​for the object to a valid state, gives a designer the opportunity to say that these fields are &quot;given&quot; by the establishment. If you have not defined any constructor (as above), Java will insert an &quot;empty&quot;, and this is called but does not change the object&#39;s initial state. A constructor differs from a conventional method in that it does not have any return type. In addition, the constructor having the same name as the class. The designer here takes a person object and associates it with the artist field. That is, if one is to create an object of class Song, as defined above, must provide one person object. Here it introduced a new constructor in addition to the previous code snippet. The new constructor takes an extra parameter t, which is used to set the title of the Song object. When you now create a new Song object will be able to choose which of the designers you want to use by &quot;send to&quot; the extra parameter, or not. See next column for examples of how constructors are used. The code above shows how a variable, s, is declared and attached to another object. S Song - represents the variable declaration. new Song () - equivalent to the creation of the object. s1 refers here to a Song object where its constructor has &quot;welcomed&quot; a person object. s2 refers to a Song object where its constructor has &quot;accepted&quot; both a person object and a string s3 is here declared to be linked to a Song object. But here is the new Song (); void since the class Song does not have this constructor. When the class has constructors sets not support an &quot;empty&quot;, as it would have done otherwise. Object References To describe the relationship between a variable and an object has so far been used terms that variable is &quot;related to&quot;, &quot;refer to&quot;, &quot;hold on&quot; object etc. This should be attempted clarified. In the code examples above, it is not the case that example. s2 is a Song object, but s2 pointer / reference a Song object. This can be illustrated with figures. Fig 1 Fig 2 Fig 3 Fig 4 Note that if you are in a situation such as Figure 3 If you change the object s1 refers to, one would also have changed the object s2 refers to, since these are the same object."}
