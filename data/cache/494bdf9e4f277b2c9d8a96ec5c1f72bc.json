At compile java code gets you wrote translated into Java bytecode, which the machine understands. At runtime, the code is executed on your computer. Java bytecode is outside the curriculum in TDT4100, but for the interested reader IBM has a good article on the bytecode, and why the program should be something about this. Compiling and running in Eclipse If you have set up Eclipse right it is very easy to run your program. By pressing the green &quot;play&quot; button on the toolbar at the top of Eclipse will both compile and run the program. If you use ACM charge will appear an applet in a separate window where input to and output from the program is displayed. Using the main method and System.out.println () will see a console window at the bottom of Eclipse that takes input and gives output of the application. You must make sure to choose the correct class before running the program. If you use ACM must have a run () method to run, and otherwise must have a main method. What you need for the compiler to know how to start the program! A small technical prowess: in order to find errors in your code Eclipse will ever compile your code. If you try to compile a class from the console (see below) you will get the same errors and warnings that Eclipse provides! Compiling and running from the command line, some will say that all computer scientists must be able to run a program from the command line, and if you do not use Eclipse (or another IDE) is the way to do it. You can get however way through TDT4100 without seeing a command line, so this tutorial from Oracle is voluntary reading!"}
