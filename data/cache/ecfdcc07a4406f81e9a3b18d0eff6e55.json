Take the test class for the class as an example: Here we have three test methods, each of which creates an instance and test the behavior of respectively the constructor, and. We see that all rigs up as authorities and if this had been more than one line of code, then it would be okay to collect this code in a separate method using, for example. called rig bodies, called at the beginning of each test method: Since this is a relatively common event has JUnit framework built-in support for such assistance method. This is declared in the TestCase class and is called automatically by the JUnit framework before each test method. Test classes that want to rig up bodies, or otherwise make preparations before the tests can redefine the method with the desired content. Each test method is ensured that bodies are rigged up, and since this happens again for each test method, these can run wild with bodies without messing things up for the other test methods. The code above can thus be rewritten as follows: In some cases, it is rigged by the method also had to be rigged down, not to litter system tests run on. It may eg. be practical to create any temporary data files in method, and then they must be removed afterwards. It will not be very neat to do this in the test methods themselves, since one must then use to ensure that it happens regardless of the outcome of the test. Therefore supports JUnit framework one method, called automatically after each test method is run, regardless of whether the test was interrupted or not. As is the custom in-class and suitable for redefinition. In case the above is not such a method required (each test method is run on a new instance of Counter Test), but a test class with a method could look like this: In practice, not so often, but when setup changes the state of the system outside the tests, so one should consider using it!
