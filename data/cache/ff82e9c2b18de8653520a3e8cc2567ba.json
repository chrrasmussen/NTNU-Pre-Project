You will include a good overview of the various files you have, code completion, and to find errors in your program. Eclipse is built as a plug-in based utility, and there are therefore numerous extensions that can help you. The code is organized in projects, which is a collection of code that belong together. In this course, we have such a project with all code pertaining to rehearsals and another project with all code belonging to the class. If you want to create a separate app, it is natural to create a separate project for this. Proper use of Eclipse makes it easier to write code faster and more accurate. These pages are in no way an exhaustive manual for Eclipse, but meant as an introduction to the use of the tool. To get started, see Installation. Eclipse also has separate pages of documentation to get started with and use the program."}
