You can choose between many different but if you do not have strong opinions about what suits you as Oracle&#39;s JDK (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) work fine . JDK you need to compile and run Java applications on your computer. More about compiling and running can be found on Driving Driving. The Eclipse downloaded separately. Go to http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ and select the correct operating system on top! You can choose from many different versions of Eclipse. It does not have much to say who you choose - you can download Installing addition that makes the different versions are similar. If you do not know which version you need the &quot;Eclipse Standard&quot; work fine. Eclipse is downloaded as a. Zip file, and this extract (right click and select &quot;Extract All ...&quot; in Windows, or double-click on Mac) where you want to install Eclipse. Having extracted the files, you are ready to use Eclipse, then click off in the folder and select eclipse.exe. You want to be prompted to select a workspace. This is where Eclipse will save the files you create. This can (and should!) Be somewhere other than where you installed Eclipse. See the picture below. In this way you can uninstall Eclipse (ie because you want a new version) by deleting the folder &quot;C: \\ Programming \\ Eclipse&quot;. You will retain your code, and find it again in &quot;C: \\ Programming \\ TDT4100 \\ Workspace&quot;.
